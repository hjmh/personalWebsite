      Navigational behaviors in insects
    </h3>
    <div class="hline"></div>
    <p>
      I am interested in understanding how animals move through
      space. I am particularly fascinated by the surprisingly complex
      navigational capabilities of insects, which are often considered
      to be relatively “simple” animals. Many ant and bee species,
      for example, exhibit sophisticated orientation behaviors when
      foraging and eastern North American monarch butterflies cover
      thousands of miles during their seasonal migration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We still know relatively little about how complex navigational
      behaviors arise and I think that porting some of the complexity
      of the natural environment and the challenges animals face in the
      wild to the lab will help study their neural basis.
      In the next section I illustrate <a href="#approach">this approach</a> in
      a little more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently I am trying to understand how visually guided navigation can
      change based on past experiences in walking fruit flies. More specifically,
      my work aims to address questions related to the use of visual landmark cues
      in the context of a specific, visually guided task and how this visual
      information is integrated with the fly’s internal representation(s) of the
      environment.
      <br>
      To this end I have developed several paradigms for conditioning a fly’s
      preference for different visual landmarks, with the goal of training flies
      to seek relief from punishment or collecting a reward at one of two
      landmark types. These paradigms are in principle compatible with
      2-photon imaging, as the fly is head-fixed and interacts with a
      virtual environment.

    </p>
    <p>
      So far I have worked on different aspects of navigation in
      <i>Drosophila</i> larve, adult flies, and crickets. You can find out
      more about individual projects <a href="#portfolio">here</a>.

      Virtual reality approach
    </h3>
    <p> To study the neural basis of navigational behaviors, I place fruit flies
      in a 2D virtual reality. While these experimental virtual worlds might
      rather abstract at first sight, they catpture some important features of
      natural enviroments the animal could have enounterd in the wild.

      The fly navigates a virtual 2D space, thus it’s position and what it
      sees at any point in time are not strictly coupled
      (as is the case in existing head-fixed conditioning paradigms).
