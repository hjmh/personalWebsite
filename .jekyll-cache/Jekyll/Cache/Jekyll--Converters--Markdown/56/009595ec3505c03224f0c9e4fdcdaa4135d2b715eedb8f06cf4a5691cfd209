I"<p>The goal of the project was to see if we could change a larva’s behavior by coupling the delivery of an aversive stimulus to certain actions (left turns, running straight, …). This kind of learning is called operant conditioning: the animal learns the consequence of a particular action and adapts its behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>We placed individual larva on a small agarose-filled dish, where they readily crawl around, presumably looking for food. We filmed the behavior of the larva and used computer vision to automatically detect the occurrence a certain movements online. This information was used to couple the delivery of punishment (a short vibration of the dish) to specific behaviors.</p>

<p>During my time in the lab I tried out a few different paradigms differing in the types of movements that were punished. I found that larvae changed their behavior in response to vibration punishment of turns. However, a control experiment, in which vibration punishment was uncoupled from the animal’s behavior, revealed that this behavioral change was an unspecific adaptation to the punishment rather than the result of operant conditioning.</p>

<p>These unsuccessful attempts of conditioning larva do not necessarily imply that larvae are incapable of operant learning. One possibility, for example, is that we picked out movements as “behaviors” that do not correspond to modules that can easily be associated with a consequence. Another possibility is that the unspecific adaptation of reducing turns was effective enough to reduce experience of punishment, that the animals did not experience of the punishment was not sufficient to learn the association between behavior and consequence.</p>

<p>While we were not able to operantly train larvae with vibration stimuli, my experiments led to the conclusion that vibration stimuli are aversive and others were able to show that olfactory conditioning with vibration is possible (see publication below).</p>
