          <h3>About Me</h3>

          <p>
            As long as I remember, I have enjoyed observing animals and wondering
            what drives their different behaviors. The realization that detailed
            observations and quantitative analysis can reveal surprising solutions
            animals find to solve the problems that they encounter is what
            eventually drew me into animal behavior research. Today I work as a
            postdoctoral associate in
            <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/jayaraman-lab" target="_blank" >Vivek Jayaraman's lab</a> at
            <a href="https://www.janelia.org/" target="_blank">HHMI Janelia Research Campus</a> studying
            neural mechanisms underlying navigation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently I'm working on three different projects.
            First, I’m combining a virtual reality system that I developed
            during my PhD (see below) with two-photon calcium imaging to
            investigate <b>how flies stay oriented</b> in
            dynamic and cluttered two-dimensional visual environments.
            In a second navigation project I am working, in close collaboration
            with Dennis Goldschmidt from Carlos Ribeiro’s lab (Champalimaud) and
            Ann Hermundstad (Janelia), on understandig behavioral strategies
            and neural mechanisms underlying <b>foraging decisions</b> in flies.
            In a third, also highly collaborative project, I’ve been analyzing
            the <b>central complex connectivity</b> using the recently published
            fruit fly connectome.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I like to sew and paint, both of which help me
            to recharge and relax. I encourage those interested in <b>sewing</b> to check out my blog at
            <a href="https://hannahsews.com" target="_blank"> hannahsews.com</a>, where I share
            some of my sewing projects and explain the process behind their creation.
            I also love looking at plants
            (I rarely miss an opportunity for visiting a new botanical garden) and
            observing animals – particularly birds and insects – and recently
            became pet parent to a former homing pigeon.

      <h3>Living with a chronic, "invisible" illness</h3>
    </div>

      <p>
        Since I got diagnosed with a chronic condition called <b>Sjögrens Syndrome</b>
        I am trying to raise awareness for this poorly understood, "invisible disease".

        Briefly, Sjögren’s (“SHOW-grins”) is a systemic autoimmune disease
        that affects the entire body. It is caused by the immune system attacking
        your own organs. In case of Sjögren's typically the tear and salivary glands
        are attacked and damaged leading to dry eyes and mouth. However, the disease
        may also cause the immune system to attack other organs and it can cause
        profound fatigue, joint pain, nausea, dizziness, headaches, neuropathies and lymphomas.
        <br><br>

        Sjögren's is a chronic disease and there is no cure at present.
        It is hard to put in words what it means to live with such a chronic inflammatory
        disease. One of the biggest challenges for me was to get used to unpredictability of
        my physical condition: the symptoms listed above and more can flare up
        suddenly and then disappear completely, making it sometimes difficult to plan.
        Small disturbances such as lack of sleep or a light cold can now knock
        me out for several days. Further, the ever-returning symptoms
        are emotionally draining, as they can cause the perception that there
        is no progress, no healing. <br><br>

        I have been fortunate to be diagnosed soon after the first symptoms
        appeared and I have gotten treatment that has helped me to return to a
        more or less normal life. However, there is no guarantee that my current medication
        it will continue to work for me. Generally, this disease, like other autoimmune conditions,
        is characterized by a shocking lack of understanding, despite the large number of
        people that are affected (4 million Americans according to the Sjögren’s
        foundation). 90 % of patients are women. My hope is that awareness
        will eventually increase and more research will lead to faster
        diagnosis, better treatment and maybe even prevention.
        For more information, I recommend the official website of the
        <a href="https://www.sjogrens.org" target="_blank">Sjögrens Syndrome Foundation</a>.
