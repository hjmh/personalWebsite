          <h4>About Me</h4>

          <p>I'm a postdoctoral associate working in
            <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/jayaraman-lab" target="_blank" >Vivek Jayaraman's lab</a>
            at <a href="https://www.janelia.org/" target="_blank">HHMI Janelia Research Campus</a>.
            You can learn more about <b>my research</b> on animal navigation
            <a href "/research">here</a>. My full <b>CV</b> is available
            <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/CV_HHaberkern.pdf" target="_blank" > here </a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time I like sewing and painting, both of which help me
            to recharge and relax. Those interested in <b>sewing</b>, I'd encourage to check out
            <a href="https://thoughtsintothevoidblog.wordpress.com" target="_blank"> my blog</a>,
            where I share some of my sewing projects.
            Especially when the weather is good, I also enjoy pottering around in my garden
            (watching things grow feels so satisfying!).
            Generally, I love looking at plants (I rarely miss an oportunity for
            visiting a new botanical garden) and observing animals – particularely birds and insects.

            Since I got diagnosed with a chronic condition called <b>Sjögrens Syndrome</b>
            I am also trying to raise awareness for this poorly understood, "invisible disease".

            Briefly, Sjögren’s (“SHOW-grins”) is a systemic autoimmune disease
            that affects the entire body. It is caused by the immune system attacking
            your own organs. In case of Sjögrens typically the tear and salivary glands
            are attacked and damaged leading to dry eyes and mouth. However, the disease
            may also cause the immune system to attack other organs and it can cause
            profound fatigue, joint pain, nausea, dizziness, headaches, neuropathies and lymphomas.
            <br><br>

            Sjögren's is a chronic disease and there is no cure at present.
            It is hard to put in words what it means to live with such a chronic inflammatory
            disease. One of the biggest challenges for me was to get used to unpredictability of
            my physical condition: the symptoms listed above and more can flare up
            suddenly and then disappear completely, making it sometimes difficult to plan.
            Small disturbances such as lack of sleep or a light cold can now knock
            me out for several days. Further, the ever returning symptoms
            are emotionally draining, as they can cause the perception that there
            is no progress, no healing. <br><br>

            I have been fortunate to be diagnosed soon after the first symptoms
            appeared and I have gotten treatment that has helped me to return to a
            normal life. However, the medication I take has risks and some day I may
            need to stop taking it. There is also no guarantee that it will continue
            to work for me.<br>
            Generally, this disease, like other autoimmune conditions,
            is characterized by a shocking lack of understanding, although many
            people are affected (4 million Americans according to the Sjögren’s
            foundation). 90 % of patients are women. My hope is that awareness
            will eventually increase and more research will lead to faster
            diagnosis, better treatment and maybe even prevention.
            For more information, I recommend the official website of the
            <a href="https://www.sjogrens.org" target="_blank">Sjögrens Syndrome Foundation</a>.
