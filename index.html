        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <div class="hline"></div>
        <p>Hi, I'm Hannah. I'm a neuroscientist interested in understanding (neural) mechanisms underlying animal behavior.
          If I'm not in the lab or analysing data, I like to sew or observe animals.
          Originally I'm from Germany, but currently I live near Washington DC in the US.

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <div class="hline"></div>
        <p>My scientific interest in centered around understanding how the environment and
          past experiences shape animal behavior. I'm currently working as postdoctoral associate in
          <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/jayaraman-lab" target="_blank" >Vivek Jayaraman's lab</a>
          at <a href="https://www.janelia.org/" target="_blank">Janelia</a>.
          In Vivek's lab I invstigate neural mechanisms that help flies orient in dynamic, naturalistic
          environments. To do this, I combine 2-photon calcium imaging and virtual reality. In collaboration with Dennis Goldschmidt from Carlos Ribeiro's lab
          I further study navigational strategies that allow flies to balance exploration and exploitation in the context of foraging.
          Previous research projects involved various aspects of navigation in adult and
          larval fruit flies and crickets.

        <h3>Sewing</h3>
        <div class="hline"></div>
        <p> I greatly enjoy designing and sewing quilts, clothes and other objects made from fabric.
          I learned how to sew from my mother and grandmother and many of my favorite
          childhood memories evolve around this activity.
          These days sewing serves as a compensatory activity to research —
          as a creative outlet and by making me feel productive.</p>
