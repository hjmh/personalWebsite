      <h4>Navigational behaviors in insects</h4>
      <p>
        I am interested in understanding how animals move through
        space. I am particularly fascinated by the surprisingly complex
        <strong>navigational capabilities of insects</strong>, which are often (falsely, I think)
        refered to as “simple” animals. Many ant and bee species exhibit
        sophisticated orientation behaviors when foraging.
        Other insects such as the North American monarch butterflies or
        the Australian bogong moths cover thousands of miles during their
        seasonal migration. We still know relatively little about how these complex navigational
        behaviors arise.<br>
        <br>
        I believe that identifying and <strong>recreating important features
        of natural environments in the lab</strong>, and developping behavioral paradigms that
        are inspired by challenges animals face in the wild will be necessary to
        understand the underlying neural computations.
        <a href="#approach">This approach</a> will be described in
        a more detail in the next section. So far I have worked on different aspects of navigation in
        <i>Drosophila</i> larve, adult flies, and crickets. <a href="/portfolio/">More about these projects.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently I am trying to understand how <strong>visually guided navigation</strong> can
        change based on <strong>past experiences</strong> in walking fruit flies. More specifically,
        my work aims to address questions related to the use of visual landmark cues
        in the context of a specific, visually guided task and how this visual
        information is integrated with the fly’s internal representation(s) of the
        environment. To this end I have developed several paradigms for conditioning a fly’s
        preference for different visual landmarks, with the goal of training flies
        to seek relief from punishment or collecting a reward at one of two
        landmark types. These paradigms are in principle compatible with
        2-photon imaging, as the fly is head-fixed and interacts with a
        virtual environment.

      <h3>Virtual reality approach</h3>
      <p> To study the neural basis of navigational behaviors, I place fruit flies
        in a 2D virtual reality. These experimental virtual worlds are
        rather abstract at first sight, but they catpture some important features of
        natural enviroments:

        <ul>
          <li><b>2D worlds:</b> The animal navigates a virtual 2D space, thus it’s position and what it
            sees at any point in time are not strictly coupled.</li>
          <li><b>Coupling of movement and sensory experience:</b> The animals walking
            maneuvres affect what the animal's sensory experience. </li>
          <li><b>Naturatistic stimulus statistics:</b> Sensory stimuli are generated
            by the animal, which results in specific stimulus statistics. </li>
          <li><b>Rich set of visual features:</b> Movement in 2D generates characteristic
            visual stimuli such as regressive optic flow, parallax and looming stimuli.</li>
          <li><b>Approachable objects:</b> Landmarks in these worlds are in close proximity
            to the fly and can be reached. They can also be approached from multiple
            directions and can thus be seen from different perspectives.</li>
