          My goal is to understand how complex behavior arises from the interplay of an animal’s
          nervous system, its physical needs, and its sensory environment.
          <br>
          <br>
          To do this, I develop novel <b>behavioral paradigms in virtual reality</b>
          that can be combined with <b>two-photon calcium imaging</b>
          to monitor and perturb neural circuits in actively navigating animals.
          This approach is complemented with <b>connectomic analysis</b> as well as <b>behavioral studies in unrestrained animals</b> and <b>modeling</b>.
          <br>
          I have applied these methods to study navigation in flies and crickets.

        <h3>Current work</h3>
        <p>Currently I'm working on three different projects:</p>

        <div class="hline"></div>
        <p>
          First, I’m combining a virtual reality system that I developed
          during my PhD (see below) with two-photon calcium imaging to
          investigate <b>how flies stay oriented</b> in
          dynamic and cluttered two-dimensional visual environments.
        </p>
        <div class="hline"></div>
        <p>
          In a second navigation project I am working, in close collaboration
          with Dennis Goldschmidt from Carlos Ribeiro’s lab (Champalimaud) and
          Ann Hermundstad (Janelia), on understandig behavioral strategies
          and neural mechanisms underlying <b>foraging decisions</b> in flies.
        </p>
        <div class="hline"></div>
        <p>
          In a third, also highly collaborative project, I’ve been analyzing
          the <b>central complex connectivity</b> using the recently published
          fruit fly connectome.

        <h3> Technology development and data sharing</h3>
        <div class="hline-w"></div>
        <p style="color:white">
          Throughout my PhD and postdoc I developed new experimental hardware and software. I documented and shared hardware components and
          additional information for software tools on our lab’s tool-related website and released code as well as raw data here.
          <br>
          <br>
          The unity-based virtual reality software tools that I’m developing at the moment in collaboration with Janelia's Scientific Computing
          department are freely available on github. Further, I wrote two packages in python to aid analysis of (two-photon) imaging data (<b>fly2p</b>)
          and behavior data from the virtual reality system (<b>unityvr</b>).
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, I'm on a quest to design physiology fly holders that allow for bigger visual field of view. This is an ongoing struggle...

     Previous experimental projects have touched on different aspects of navigation in adult and larval fruit flies as well as crickets.
     I have also done some modeling work in cell and structural biology.

        <div class="hline-w"></div>
        <h4 style="color:#ffccb3; text-align: center;">
          Increasing diversity, equity and inclusion in neuroscience requires attracting diverse scientists, and retaining these scientists in an environment where they can thrive.

          <br>
          As a female scientist in a male-dominated field, I experience gender-based bias firsthand, and as a scientist with a chronic illness, I’m sensitized to ableist practices in academia. I found support in a women’s mentoring group at my institute. The exchange of experiences and support through a peer group is invaluable in reinforcing a sense of belonging in a workplace where oneself is in a minority. If not already in place, I would establish a similar system in future workspaces.
